Tableau Visualization of Car Prices over the years in Egypt

Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahempapy/used-cars-price/data

The Dataset includes the prices for various car models over the years in Egypt. The dataset includes:
- model
- Build year
- mileage
- fuel type
- price

Note that originally the dataset have the prices in Egyptian Pound, I created an additional column where I converted the prices to US-Dollar
Also I found a typo in the dataset: One Model had its Build year at 20224 which was changed by me to 2024

Here are the screenshots of my visualization:
